    "# You will write several functions for our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# You will be asked to implement a number of functions that altogether can do naive k-means clustering. K-means clustering is available as a built-in routine or functionality provided by external libraries in both R and Python. However, here, instead of relying on these pre-existing tools, we will write our own solution to help illuminate the workings of one of the most basic unsupervised machine learning algorithms and how it can be applied to real world data.\n",

    "# As our dataset you will be analysing Airbnb listings in Dublin (from 7 November 2021). This data was collected by Inside Airbnb, independent project to assess the impact of Airbnb platform on urban living.\n",

    "# You can use either Python or R to implement your solutions. Solutions that mix Python and R code (either within one part or across parts) will not be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Keep your functions simple and streamlined. Do not 'overengineer' your solutions (especially when implementing k-means algorithm). Do not use external libraries other than those specified for each part."
